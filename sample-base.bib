    abstract = {In order to better understand the seemingly paradoxical online behavior of smartphone users, i.e. the privacy paradox, we conduct a survey study comprising 488 German university students. Our results indicate that users can be categorized into four different clusters according to their perception of benefits and risks associated with smartphone usage, i.e. ‘indifferent’, ‘benefit-oriented’, ‘ambivalent’ and ‘risk-oriented’ user groups. These clusters show statistically significant differences in terms of age, gender and smartphone usage as well as various privacy-related variables including privacy concerns, awareness for privacy threats, willingness to disclose personal information, trust towards providers of online services, and privacy protection behavior. Moreover, we identify factors that determine an individual’s propensity to employ privacy-protective responses. Our model can be used to predict users’ inclination to protect their online privacy based on the used operating system, their willingness to disclose personal information, reported privacy concerns, privacy literacy, and trust towards online companies.},

While holding parents responsible for the consequences of children’s online actions and overall well-being, we often overlook the importance of and need for means that can effectively support parents in interacting and engaging in activities with their children. In the present study, we describe and evaluate a collaborative family game called “CyberFamily” to facilitate parent–child collaboration and leverage family communication, intending to increase cybersecurity awareness among children aged 9–12. We also present the results of two user studies: one conducted with four parent–child dyads to test the feasibility of the game and a second user study conducted with 11 parent–child dyads focusing on evaluating the usability of CyberFamily. Our findings yielded positive feedback and showed that a collaborative family game like CyberFamily can help parents engage with their children’s online activities, leading to discussions and the potential for collaborative learning for both groups. We suggest that future researchers and designers consider and provide an active, engaging role for parents when developing solutions to raise cybersecurity awareness among children, rather than just having parents monitor and control children’s online access and activities.}

    Abstract = {Information security awareness (ISA) has become a vital issue for organizations, as security breaches are usually attributed to human errors. ISP programs are effective ways to educate employees and enhance their information security knowledge. Gamification is a new concept in the area of ISA programs and it has been proven to be one of the most effective and proper ISA methods in both the private and public sectors. Despite a growing interest in employing gamification as an ISP program in recent years, there is a lack of study to provide a comprehensive overview of gamification within ISA programs and identify trends, patterns, and research gaps in this area in order to direct future research. To bridge this gap, a systematic mapping study is adopted as a research methodology. A total of 69 papers were selected and classified by document type, year of publication, research type, research contribution, gamification type, gamification in terms of adaptivity based on the target group, and gamification in terms of the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in order to make it user-tailored. The mapping study revealed that the published papers in this area were split between journals and conference papers with a higher proportion published in conference proceedings. Regarding the publication trend, from 2015 to 2022, gamification within ISA programs has come across to researchers' attention. The identified two main research types were evaluation research and validation research and the vast majority of the contribution type was tools. Moreover, content gamification has been used more commonly in ISA programs than structural gamification. Furthermore, the finding indicated that there were clear gaps in employing adaptive gamification, dynamic adaptive gamification and AI-based adaptive gamification, which makes these areas significant for future research.},

In traditional desktop and mobile contexts, the primary user interface is a screen; however, in IoT devices, screens are rare or very small, invalidating many existing approaches to protecting user privacy. Privacy visualizations are a common approach for assisting users in understanding the privacy implications of web and mobile services. To gain a thorough understanding of IoT privacy, we examine existing web, mobile, and IoT visualization approaches. Following that, we define five major privacy factors in the IoT context: type, usage, storage, retention period, and access. We then describe notification methods used in various contexts as reported in the literature. We aim to highlight key approaches that developers and researchers can use for creating effective IoT privacy notices that improve user privacy management (awareness and control). Using a toolkit, a use case scenario, and two examples from the literature, we demonstrate how privacy visualization approaches can be supported in practice.},
