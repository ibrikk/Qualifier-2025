    abstract = {In order to better understand the seemingly paradoxical online behavior of smartphone users, i.e. the privacy paradox, we conduct a survey study comprising 488 German university students. Our results indicate that users can be categorized into four different clusters according to their perception of benefits and risks associated with smartphone usage, i.e. ‘indifferent’, ‘benefit-oriented’, ‘ambivalent’ and ‘risk-oriented’ user groups. These clusters show statistically significant differences in terms of age, gender and smartphone usage as well as various privacy-related variables including privacy concerns, awareness for privacy threats, willingness to disclose personal information, trust towards providers of online services, and privacy protection behavior. Moreover, we identify factors that determine an individual’s propensity to employ privacy-protective responses. Our model can be used to predict users’ inclination to protect their online privacy based on the used operating system, their willingness to disclose personal information, reported privacy concerns, privacy literacy, and trust towards online companies.},
